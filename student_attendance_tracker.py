# Scenario: You're building an app to track student attendance for a course. You receive a list

# student was present.
# Problem:
# Write a method that takes multiple List<String> (one per day) and returns a Map<String
#bascially they asked for a dictonary with names of student and there attendance
# Integer> containing each student's total attendance.
